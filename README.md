# PID Ball Balancer

A couple years back Electronoobs built [a very simple PID example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFTJ2SS4xyA) that balanced a ping-pong ball. (Of course [it was covered on Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2019/07/31/ping-pong-ball-makes-great-pid-example/) which is how it grabbed my attention.) I've always wanted to give it a try and have just taken the plunge. It's not so much the physical build I'm interested in, but I really want to write the PID code from scratch to ensure a thorough understanding of the concepts.

## Work in Progress

Built the balancer:

Wrote a calibration program that lest you type 0-180 arc values into serial terminal to find out where home points should be

## TODO

* Attach VL53 line of flight sensor to the aparatus
* Write the PID code
